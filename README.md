# xcat_ng_fw

Firmware for the next generation Xcat code plug replacement project for Syntor X and X9000 radios

https://github.com/skiphansen/xcat_ng_fw

## Status

At the moment most of our effort is dedicated to reverse engineering the Syntor X9000 firmware to gain enough understanding of the radio to **OWN** it.
See the [research](https://github.com/skiphansen/xcat_ng_fw/tree/main/research#readme) directory for the gory details and some scripts which
have been developed to assist the reverse engineering effort.

The Syntor (non X9000) however is well understood.  Firmware for it is waiting someone to build the hardware necessary to interface a Raspberry Pi Pico
to the radio.  Since this has been done before (18 years ago) with a PIC the software is well understood and **JUST** needs to be translated from
PIC assembly languate to C (grin).

Currently the Pico code here is just the Blinky example from [the pico examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples) with
Cmake files changes to decouple it from the example repo.

## Building Blinky

1. [Install Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)
2. Clone this repository
3. cd into xcat_ng_fw/SyntorX
4. Create a build directory
5. cd into the build directory
6. Create make files using Cmake
7. Run make
