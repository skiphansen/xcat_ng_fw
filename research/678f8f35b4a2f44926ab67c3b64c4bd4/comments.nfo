comment C77F .Observed values for first two bytes of a
comment C77F .code plug are 0x07ff (2047) and 0x1fff
comment C77F .(8191).  First bytes of FFFF seem to mean
comment C77F .a bad ROM (reading "nothing there" would
comment C77F .return FF bytes, right?), and we branch
comment C77F .to code which further refines that diagnosis.
lcomment C77F             Now we should have 0x0800, 0x2000, or 0x0000.
lcomment C780          If we got 0xFFFF, go refine diagnosis
lcomment C783       Now we should have 0x8800 or 0xa000.
lcomment C786             Not clear how this would ever see nonzero.
comment C787 .Guessing this is a way to further check
comment C787 .ROM size -- if low-order byte is not FF
comment C787 .(now incremented, so 0x00) then something
comment C787 .is scrambled?  This means the code works
comment C787 .for ROM sizes other than 2x16 and 2x64.
lcomment C789          All observed inputs would lead to 0 and no branch.
comment C78B .Again, guessing this check against the high-order
comment C78B .byte of the size is done this way to allow
comment C78B .ROMs larger than 2x16 and 2x64.
